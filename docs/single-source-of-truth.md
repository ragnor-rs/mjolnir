# How the single-authority claim is held

[`../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md`](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md) declares itself the
single statement of every rule and flow, and this document and its sibling explain or record
without being a second authority. This document states none of the rules either. It records what
the gate checks, which kind of check each one is, and — the part worth reading — what it
deliberately does not check.

The check is `tools/check_single_source.py`, run by the `Checks` workflow on every pull request
and every push to the default branch, and stated in this repository's own `host.checks`.

A second script, `tools/check_no_project_names.py`, holds a different claim — that this repository
names no other project, and that nothing carrying procedure carries a value. It runs in its own
`Names no other project` workflow, and is stated in `host.checks` as its own entry: a
`host.checks` entry states one mirrored command, so a second job of `Checks` would have been a
second command with nowhere on the surface to live. It is recorded in
[its own section](#the-second-sweep-naming-no-other-project) below, because the two claims share
this document's discipline of stating every limit and not its subject.

`tools/check_nothing_deferred.py` holds a claim about the change rather than about the tree: that
nothing in it was deferred. It runs in its own `Nothing deferred` workflow and has its own
`host.checks` entry, for the same reason the sweep does, and is recorded in
[its own section](#the-gate-on-the-change-nothing-is-deferred) below. It is the one that reaches
off the tree, and the one granted a token scope — stated there rather than discovered in a
workflow file. (No count of the gates is given, here or below: a count in prose is a copy that
goes stale on the next gate, green.)

## Why this is a check rather than a convention

Every other duplication in this backlog is one the toolkit exists to delete. This one is the
toolkit's own. The procedure is described in the schema, in the README, in the three documents
under `docs/`, in each shipped skill, and in the issue bodies — and only the schema is an
authority. Nothing held the rest to that. A rule restated in a document, a section nothing
motivates, a ruling pointing at a home its outcome has since left: each reads as fine in review,
and each is the defect this repository was built to call a defect.

Three were in the tree when the check was written, which is the argument for it:

- `version` was in all five configurations and declared nowhere in the schema — a key every
  adopter writes, that the single statement of the surface did not name. It is now
  [schema § The file itself](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-file-itself).
- One ruling's outcome lived in the README, which stated that rule citing no schema section, so
  the README was a second authority for exactly one rule. It is now
  [schema § 7 → Invocation](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#invocation), which the README
  cites. It sits as a subsection of the carrier axis rather than as a numbered section of its
  own, because every numbered section is a configuration facet opening with a `yaml` block and
  this is procedure — the same placement the authorship rule has under § 6.
- Two rulings pointed at "the filing role's work item" and "the deploy role's work item" with no
  number, so nothing could resolve whether the outcome had moved. They now name #7 and #13.

## The three kinds, and why one of them is absent

[Work item #28](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/28) classifies the checks themselves,
from two independent implementations that reached the same conclusion: **computed** checks derive
the property and cannot be fooled by a reword; **forbidding** checks assert a name or pattern must
not appear, and are sound when the thing forbidden is stable; **quoting** a sentence back at the
file it came from fails in both directions. Every check below is one of the first two.

| # | Check | Scope | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Every markdown document that may cite the schema has a declared role in the script | root `*.md`, `docs/**`, `plugins/**` | forbidding |
| 1 | Every citation of the schema resolves — **both its path and its fragment** | every document with a role | computed |
| 2 | Every `##`-level schema section is cited by at least one document | `##` only, not `###` | computed |
| 3 | Every ruling's outcome cell resolves, and its § number and its link agree | the `Outcome lives in` column | computed |
| 4 | A ⛔ statement carries a citation naming a **section** | documents that explain or record | forbidding |
| 5 | Every configuration's top-level key set equals the one the schema declares | top level only | computed |

Check 2 is the one that does the most work, because it runs in the direction nobody remembers to
check by hand: a section added to the schema with nothing recording why it has that shape fails
the build at the moment it is added, rather than being noticed a year later by someone wondering
whether it is load-bearing. ⚠️ It holds `##` sections only, so a `###` subsection that no
document motivates passes — and some do today, including a ⛔ rule of its own. The direction is
enforced one level less deeply than it reads. No number is given here on purpose: a count of them
is a fact about the schema, and a copy of it in this document would go stale on the next
subsection either way, green.

Check 4 is scoped to documents that explain or record, not to a skill. That is the schema's own
[boundary rule](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-configuration-surface): a fact that cannot
be expressed on the surface is either procedure, in which case it belongs in a skill, or a
project-specific skill. A skill therefore states procedure for its own role legitimately, and the
hazard there is a *value* rather than a rule —
[#19](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/19)'s sweep. Its citations are still held by
check 1: a skill already carries one, and a dead citation in a skill is a dead citation.

Check 3 permits a third, partial home. A ruling whose outcome is split between the surface and the
skill that carries it may name `the skill` **alongside** a section — ruling 6 does — but never
instead of one. That carve-out is in the script, so it is stated here too.

⚠️ **Check 3 recognises a numbered home only**, because the cell's form is `[schema § N](…#a)`
and the number and the anchor are required to agree. A procedure rule sitting under an unnumbered
`##` section — [*Nothing is deferred*](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#nothing-is-deferred),
under the loop — therefore cannot be named as a ruling's outcome at all, and a ruling that needed
to would have to name its work item instead. Nothing needs to today; it is recorded because the
alternative is discovering it from a red build on whichever divergence first rules that way.

## The check must not become one more copy of the principles

⛔ A check that hardcoded the loop's role count, the list of axes, or which facets have an absent
case would have to be edited on every change to the surface whose
[single-authority claim](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-configuration-surface) it
enforces — this repository's own thesis violated in its own gate, and a copy that has to be kept
in sync is the defect rather than the maintenance burden.

So the script **derives every expectation from the schema at run time** and hardcodes grammar
only:

| Derived, at run time | Hardcoded |
|---|---|
| the section list, from the headings | markdown heading syntax |
| the anchor set, from the same | the code host's slug rule |
| the key vocabulary, from the fenced blocks | yaml top-level key syntax |
| the citation targets, from the anchors | the citation and outcome-cell forms |
| the rulings, from the table carrying the `Outcome lives in` column | that column's name |
| | the binding marker, and which document plays which role |

Adding a section to the schema grows what the script expects with no edit to the script, and
check 2 reddens until a document motivates it. Deleting one shrinks it the same way. Renumbering
one changes nothing either — the rulings table is found by its column header rather than by a
section number, which was a deliberate second pass: the first draft keyed on the literal heading
`## 4. The rulings`, so inserting any section above it would have broken the check on a content
change.

**The only thing that forces an edit is a change of grammar** — a new marker, a new citation
form, a new column name, a new kind of document — and that residue is made loud rather than
silent by check 0: a markdown document at the root, under `docs/`, or under `plugins/` with no
declared role fails the build instead of being quietly skipped.

This is [#28](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/28)'s own finding applied here — the
sixth instance counted in
[`configuration-surface.md`](configuration-surface.md#the-strongest-argument-for-extraction-is-not-borrowed)
is another project's document checker, and this guard is a seventh: the graph a machine walks and
the statement a person maintains are deliberately one thing, read from one place.

## What it deliberately does not check

Stated, because an unstated limit reads later as coverage.

- **Fidelity.** Whether a document's paraphrase still matches the section it cites is the
  *quoting* kind: red on an innocent reword, green when a claim is reworded into its opposite.
  No check here attempts it. It stays a reviewer's job, which is why a document paraphrases as
  little as it can and cites instead.
- **Issue state.** Check 3 resolves the *form* of a work-item cell, not whether that issue is
  still open. Reading the tracker needs a token scope, and per
  [#50](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/50) this workflow is granted none: its
  `permissions` are empty and the checkout is told to persist no credential. So a ruling whose
  work item landed without its outcome moving into the schema is caught by a reader, not by the
  gate — the one gap in check 3 worth knowing about, and a deliberate trade against holding a
  credential to close it.
- **Key subtrees.** Check 5 holds the top level only. Per-tracker blocks live in `examples/` by
  the schema's own
  [§ 3](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#3-tracker-port), so a deeper comparison would need an
  exception per tracker kind. A bounded check that is sound beats a deep one that needs
  carve-outs, and `tracker.labels` being undeclared is the known consequence.
- **Issues and pull requests.** Not from *this* workflow, which holds no credential — reading
  that store needs a token scope, and per [#50](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/50)
  this one is granted none. ⚠️ It is not unreachable in principle, and this document used to say
  it was: the gate on the change below does read it, with a scope of its own. What stays true
  here is the trade, not the impossibility. The lettering of projects A–F in the documentation
  rests on the same reason [#19](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/19) records.
- **Configurations outside the globs.** A configuration added where `CONFIG_GLOBS` does not look
  is skipped. Check 0's loud-residue argument covers documents; for configurations the guard
  asserts only that each glob matched something, which catches a moved directory but not a new
  one somewhere else.

## The second sweep: naming no other project

The convention in the README — that this repository names no *other* project — and the surface's
own rule that [no value appears under a carrier
root](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-configuration-surface) both say the **search is the
check** rather than a reading of the procedure. `tools/check_no_project_names.py` is that search,
in its own workflow. **Seven of its nine checks are of the *forbidding* kind**, so most of the
script stands or falls on whether the thing forbidden has a stable form; the two computed ones
exist to stop the other seven holding nothing.

Two scopes. The repository-wide one looks for what identifies someone else's project; the strict
one — the carrier roots, never the whole tree — looks for a value, a tracker or a stack in text
that is supposed to be procedure. A carrier is a skill, a command or a hook (schema § 7), so the
strict set is matched by *shape* — `plugins/*/skills/`, `commands/`, `.claude/hooks/` and so on —
rather than from a hand-kept list of roots.

| # | Check | Scope | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | No repository but this one's is named, as a URL, an install-command argument or a `repo:` value | every tracked text file | forbidding |
| 1 | No path under a home directory | same | forbidding |
| 2 | No address | same | forbidding |
| 3 | No identifier that resolves on a tracker — a Jira key or Trello id **written as a value**, or either service's URL anywhere | same | forbidding |
| 4 | The strict set matched a file at all | the carrier roots | computed |
| 5 | Every file under a plugin is a carrier, a configuration or a manifest — nothing else | `plugins/**` | computed |
| 6 | No tracker is named, in the slug spelling or the prose one | the strict set | forbidding |
| 7 | No package manager, task runner, build tool, checker, manifest or lockfile; no directory change prefixing a command, no directory flag, no absolute path | the strict set | forbidding |
| 8 | No value any configuration supplies | the strict set | forbidding |

Check 5 is the one that makes the shape-matched strict set safe: a carrier in a directory the
shapes do not reach — `plugins/other/skils/`, one letter out — would otherwise be swept by nothing
*and* reported by nothing. It runs in the other direction and makes that residue loud, which is
check 0's argument one scope over.

**Two rules are what make a forbidding sweep sound**, and they are the part worth reading:

1. **A stack token counts only as code, never as prose.** In markdown that means inside a code
   span or a fenced block; in a script it means outside the comments. `make`, `go`, `task`,
   `just`, `stack`, `bundle`, `mix` and `pod` are ordinary English words in a sentence and
   unambiguous commands in a code span, and a shebang names an absolute path by construction. A
   sweep of prose for any of them would redden on a reworded sentence, which is the *quoting*
   failure this document already rules out. ⚠️ Fenced blocks are found by a line toggle rather
   than a paired regex: one trailing space after a fence's language tag is enough to make a paired
   regex match one block's closer against the next block's opener, which hides every command and
   sweeps the prose between them instead.
2. **A value counts only as a whole code span or a whole quoted string.** A value written as a
   value stands alone in its span, so a sentence that merely contains the word is not one: a
   status vocabulary of `open` and `closed` does not forbid the word "opening", which the day-log
   skill uses freely. ⚠️ The wrap is not part of the value — this repository hard-wraps its prose
   at about 95 columns and most forbidden values are multi-word, so newlines are normalised away
   before matching. A fenced block's own backticks are removed first, for the same reason as
   rule 1: they would shift the pairing of every span after them.

It derives what it can, for the reason stated above about the check not becoming one more copy:

| Derived, at run time | Hardcoded |
|---|---|
| the one permitted slug, from `host.repo` in this project's own configuration | the host-URL, address and tracker-identifier grammars |
| the tracker names, from the `kind` alternatives of the surface's **tracker block** and every configuration's declared kind | the closed list of stack tool names |
| the forbidden value set, from the configurations themselves — this project's own included | which leaf keys of a configuration carry a project's fact |
| the file list, from `git ls-files`; the strict set, from the carrier shapes | a carrier directory's name, and the code-span and quoted-string forms of rules 1 and 2 |
| the file to plant a violation into, from the strict set | the three exceptions below |

⚠️ The tracker names are read from the `tracker:` block specifically. A line-anchored read of
every `kind:` cannot tell `host.kind: github` from `tracker.kind`, and the first draft subtracted
the host's name afterwards — an undeclared carve-out of *content* in a script that is supposed to
hardcode form, and one that silently let the host's own name through a carrier root.

Reading the forbidden values out of the configurations is what makes the acceptance item's pair
work in opposite directions: **a new example configuration adds to what is forbidden under a
carrier root instead of tripping anything, and a status word added to a skill reddens the build.**
Both were measured rather than reasoned about.

### Three exceptions, encoded rather than assumed

A literal reading of the convention would forbid all three, so each is in the script:

- **`config/examples/`** is whole example configurations and is data rather than procedure. It is
  the one place a concrete status word or label prefix is written down — the surface's own
  [boundary](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-configuration-surface) — and it is where the
  sweep reads the forbidden set *from*. The strict set asserts that nothing under a carrier root
  carries a value regardless. ⚠️ This is also the **only** place a bare all-caps value counts as a
  placeholder: `OWNER/REPO` and `KEY` are stand-ins, but a configuration that is somebody's actual
  facts has no such licence, so `TODO` and `IN_PROGRESS` there are values. The first draft applied
  the all-caps rule everywhere and so dropped the commonest status spellings — and every uppercase
  project key — out of the forbidden set entirely.
- **This repository's own slug**, derived rather than listed. Removing `host.repo` from the
  configuration reddens the build rather than quietly permitting every slug, which is one of the
  planted violations.
- **The public plugin cited as prior art.** It is an artifact rather than a project in scope, and
  it sits in a one-entry table in the script with its reason beside it, so a second entry means
  editing that table and saying why. Emptying the table reddens the build on the live citation —
  measured, so the carve-out is known to be load-bearing rather than decorative.

`docs/` is deliberately outside the strict set: it quotes the measurements the surface was derived
from and has to keep naming the build tool that reported a cached pass as work done. A rule that
forbade a tool name in a measurement would forbid the evidence.

⚠️ **The script exempts itself — that one file, not all of `tools/`.** It necessarily writes down
every token it forbids: its grammars spell out the home-directory prefixes and its planted
violations contain addresses and foreign slugs. Its sibling needs no such licence and is swept
like any other file, which matters because `tools/` is where
[#15](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/15)'s extracted evidence script and
[#50](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/50)'s linters land — and somebody's own home
path, hardcoded as a default in one of those, is exactly what check 1 exists for. The first draft
exempted the whole directory and so would have read straight past it.

### What this sweep deliberately does not check

- **A bare slug in prose.** `owner/repo` and `docs/single-source-of-truth.md` have the same shape,
  so the sound forms are the URL, the install-command argument and the `repo:` value. A workflow's
  `uses: actions/checkout@v4` is a third shape it does not read, and a slug written bare in a
  sentence is a reviewer's catch.
- **A person's name, a bare label, a milestone title, an assignee handle, a service name.** None
  has a stable form, and forbidding a list of them would be a list to keep in sync. This is the
  same reason projects are lettered A–F in the documentation: the convention is held by what the
  documents *don't* contain, and the counts carry the argument instead.
- **A language interpreter.** `python3` is on no list, and `python3 <day_log.script>` in the
  day-log skill is the one live instance of one. ⚠️ Whether a configured script is a path the
  procedure prefixes with an interpreter, or a command the procedure merely runs, is
  [#65](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/65)'s and
  [#66](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/66)'s ruling about what configuration carries.
  This check does not pre-empt it by reddening, so until that lands the interpreter named in a
  skill is a known hole — stated, because an unstated limit reads later as coverage.
- **A stack token hidden in a script's comment.** Rule 1 strips comments before sweeping a
  script, so `# run npm run build first` in a hook is not read. That is the deliberate trade: a
  comment is prose, and sweeping it would redden on an ordinary English sentence. A command the
  procedure actually runs is not in a comment.
- **A bare all-caps value inside an example configuration**, per the first exception above. The
  residue is narrow — an example whose status words are upper-case — and the alternative was
  dropping `OWNER/REPO` and `KEY` out of the placeholder set.
- **Most carrier roots are empty, and the run still exits 0.** Of the carrier shapes, only
  `plugins/*/skills/` matches anything today: the hooks that enforce the loop are
  [#16](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/16) and the command carrier belongs to
  whichever project migrates with one. The run says how many shapes swept nothing and **does not**
  fail on them, because a shape for a carrier kind this repository has not adopted is not a
  defect. What is held instead: check 4 fails if the strict set empties altogether, and check 5
  fails on a carrier sitting outside every shape.
- **Issues and pull requests**, for the same reason check 3 above cannot read issue state: that
  store is not a file, the workflow holds no credential, and a reviewer covers it.

## The gate on the change: nothing is deferred

The surface rules that a work item is delivered whole — a role that cannot answer a question asks
rather than noting it, and no change merges with an open item against it:
[schema § *Nothing is deferred*](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#nothing-is-deferred). One
sentence of that rule is the whole reason a script exists for it rather than a convention: the
completeness statement is **read back, never asserted**. A pull request that says in prose that
everything is resolved is making the same claim the defect makes.

So `tools/check_nothing_deferred.py` counts the items where they were raised — the body, and the
threads the host records a resolution for — and names each one it finds.

| # | Check | Scope | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | The pull request has a body | the change | computed |
| 1 | The body states its open items, once, and the answer is that there are none | the body | forbidding |
| 2 | No thread on the change is unresolved | every thread, following the cursor | computed |
| 3 | No unticked item in the body | the body | forbidding |
| 4 | Every changed file was read, and no deferral marker is on a line this change adds | the diff's added lines | forbidding |

⚠️ **Check 1 is *forbidding*, not computed, and the distinction is the one this document draws
above.** The heading `Open items` and the answer `None.` are a grammar the gate publishes, so the
check reddens on a reword — `Open questions` is not that heading and `Nothing outstanding.` is not
that answer. That is sound only while the forbidden thing is stable, which a grammar the gate
itself fixes is; it is not a *quoting* check, because nothing here is compared against the text it
came from. Making both strings configuration, in the repository's own language, is
[#51](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/51)'s, and this script is the implementation
that item would call rather than a second one.

**The grammar check 1 enforces, in full**, because the refusal names the items and not the shape:
an ATX heading whose text is `Open items` at any level, appearing **once**; the section running to
the next heading of any level; and, inside it, nothing but the answer — `None.` or `None`, in any
case, optionally as a list item or emphasised. Blank lines, horizontal rules and single-line HTML
comments are not content. Anything else in that section is an open item and is named as one.

Check 2 is what a reviewer cannot be, and ⚠️ it follows the cursor rather than reading a first
page, because a review that ran long is exactly the change this gate is for. Check 1 is the one
that reddens the shape the rule was written against: a body that lists what it knows is unfinished
under a heading reading as diligence — the measured case — carries no statement at all, and the
absence is what fails.

⛔ **This gate holds a token scope, and that is a departure from its siblings** rather than an
oversight in one workflow file. They read files in the tree and reach nothing; this one reads a
resolution the host records and an author cannot describe, and the surface's own rule that a
finding goes where its resolution can be read back
([§ *Nothing is deferred*](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#nothing-is-deferred)) is only worth
stating if something reads it. The scope is `pull-requests: read`, the narrowest the host offers;
nothing writes; the checkout still persists no credential, and the token is handed to the one step
that needs it rather than left in the git config.

⚠️ **What that scope did not buy, measured rather than assumed.** At the moment the gate was
written, `reviewThreads.totalCount` was **zero on every pull request this repository had ever
had**, and every review finding it had ever produced was an issue comment, which the query does
not return. So on the history to that point, body-only and body-plus-threads were
indistinguishable, and check 2 would have been green on the very pull request cited as the
measured shape. What makes the scope worth holding is not that history but the rule beside it:
a finding now goes in a thread, and the first review conducted under that rule put sixteen of them
on this gate's own pull request. ⛔ The honest reading is that check 2 is **prospective** — it
holds nothing retroactively, and a reader who takes the scope as evidence the threads were already
there has it backwards.

### What this gate deliberately does not check

- **The closing half of the rule.** No item closes carrying an unresolved item either, and that is
  a tracker write this gate neither performs nor reads. Only the merge half is held here.
- **Whether the answer is true.** `None.` is a claim, and the gate holds that the claim was made
  and that nothing it can read contradicts it. A known cost written into the summary as a feature
  reads as green — the *fidelity* limit this document already states one gate over, in a second
  place.
- **A thread resolved to clear the gate.** Resolution is the host's record of somebody's
  judgement. The gate reads the record, never the judgement.
- **A finding raised as a plain comment.** A comment carries no resolution state anywhere on the
  host, so nothing can report it unresolved — which is why the rule puts a finding in a thread.
  A finding posted where it cannot be read back is a reviewer's catch, and the one real hole in
  check 2. ⚠️ It was the whole of this repository's review record until this gate landed.
- **A marker with no colon and no argument list.** A bare `TODO` in a sentence is prose, and it
  already sits innocently in this tree — in a comment quoting a status vocabulary, and in this
  document. Sweeping prose for the word would redden on a reworded sentence, which is the
  *quoting* failure ruled out above. `FIXME` and `XXX` occur nowhere here and are carried for the
  projects that arrive with them.
- **A marker this change did not write.** Only added lines are read: somebody else's marker is
  somebody else's item.
- **A marker in the script itself.** ⚠️ That one file, not all of `tools/` — it necessarily
  writes
  down every form it forbids, and its sibling needs no such licence, which matters because `tools/`
  is where further scripts land. Both halves are asserted: the whole-change fixture carries a
  marker in this file and stays green, and a plant puts one in a sibling tool and reddens.
- **A setext heading.** `Open items` underlined with hyphens is an `h2` to the host and is not a
  heading to this gate. The residue is narrow and the alternative is a second heading grammar.
- **A pull request that does not exist yet.** Run by hand before one is opened, the gate has no
  answer and says so, and no answer is not green — the surface's rule for an absent run
  ([§ 2](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#2-code-host)) holds here for the same reason.
- **A merge that happens between the last run and the button.** The verdict is about the change as
  the last triggering event left it. The workflow listens to the review and thread events as well
  as to the pull request's own, so the window is small; it is not nothing.

## Each check has a violation it is asserted to redden on

`--self-test` plants one violation per check and asserts that check goes red, as the first step of
the workflow — before the tree is held to anything. The discipline is #28's: an assertion written
before its break tends to match only the break its author imagined, and a check that cannot fail
is not a check.

Every script here carries the mode, and each is run through it by its workflow as the first step,
before the tree — or, for the gate on the change, the pull request — is held to anything. In
each the plant count is well above the check count,
because the plant is per *branch that does real work* — a plant that reddens a check by the wrong
route proves nothing about the branch it was written for. ⛔ The numbers are deliberately not
written down here: a count in prose is a copy that has to be kept in sync, and the run prints its
own.

⚠️ **A plant may not name the file it plants into.** The sweep's first draft hardcoded the one
skill's path, so moving or renaming a carrier root made `--self-test` — the command the workflow
runs — die on a `KeyError` instead of returning a verdict. It now takes a file from the strict set
and synthesises one if the set is empty, so a moved root reddens a check rather than crashing the
gate.

That mode caught its own author. The first draft of the anchor rule collapsed runs of whitespace
where the code host replaces each space individually, which reported six sound citations as broken
— so the first finding this check produced was against itself, which is the reading rule #28
states: when one goes red, the assertion is as likely to be wrong as the document.
