# How the single-authority claim is held

[`../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md`](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md) declares itself the
single statement of every rule and flow, and this document and its sibling explain or record
without being a second authority. This document states none of the rules either. It records what
the gate checks, which kind of check each one is, and — the part worth reading — what it
deliberately does not check.

The check is `tools/check_single_source.py`, run by the `Checks` workflow on every pull request
and every push to the default branch, and stated in this repository's own `host.checks`.

## Why this is a check rather than a convention

Every other duplication in this backlog is one the toolkit exists to delete. This one is the
toolkit's own. The procedure is described in the schema, in the README, in the three documents
under `docs/`, in each shipped skill, and in the issue bodies — and only the schema is an
authority. Nothing held the rest to that. A rule restated in a document, a section nothing
motivates, a ruling pointing at a home its outcome has since left: each reads as fine in review,
and each is the defect this repository was built to call a defect.

Three were in the tree when the check was written, which is the argument for it:

- `version` was in all five configurations and declared nowhere in the schema — a key every
  adopter writes, that the single statement of the surface did not name. It is now
  [schema § The file itself](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-file-itself).
- One ruling's outcome lived in the README, which stated that rule citing no schema section, so
  the README was a second authority for exactly one rule. It is now
  [schema § 7 → Invocation](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#invocation), which the README
  cites. It sits as a subsection of the carrier axis rather than as a numbered section of its
  own, because every numbered section is a configuration facet opening with a `yaml` block and
  this is procedure — the same placement the authorship rule has under § 6.
- Two rulings pointed at "the filing role's work item" and "the deploy role's work item" with no
  number, so nothing could resolve whether the outcome had moved. They now name #7 and #13.

## The three kinds, and why one of them is absent

[Work item #28](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/28) classifies the checks themselves,
from two independent implementations that reached the same conclusion: **computed** checks derive
the property and cannot be fooled by a reword; **forbidding** checks assert a name or pattern must
not appear, and are sound when the thing forbidden is stable; **quoting** a sentence back at the
file it came from fails in both directions. Every check below is one of the first two.

| # | Check | Scope | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Every markdown document that may cite the schema has a declared role in the script | root `*.md`, `docs/**`, `plugins/**` | forbidding |
| 1 | Every citation of the schema resolves — **both its path and its fragment** | every document with a role | computed |
| 2 | Every `##`-level schema section is cited by at least one document | `##` only, not `###` | computed |
| 3 | Every ruling's outcome cell resolves, and its § number and its link agree | the `Outcome lives in` column | computed |
| 4 | A ⛔ statement carries a citation naming a **section** | documents that explain or record | forbidding |
| 5 | Every configuration's top-level key set equals the one the schema declares | top level only | computed |

Check 2 is the one that does the most work, because it runs in the direction nobody remembers to
check by hand: a section added to the schema with nothing recording why it has that shape fails
the build at the moment it is added, rather than being noticed a year later by someone wondering
whether it is load-bearing. ⚠️ It holds `##` sections only, so a `###` subsection that no
document motivates passes — and some do today, including a ⛔ rule of its own. The direction is
enforced one level less deeply than it reads. No number is given here on purpose: a count of them
is a fact about the schema, and a copy of it in this document would go stale on the next
subsection either way, green.

Check 4 is scoped to documents that explain or record, not to a skill. That is the schema's own
[boundary rule](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-configuration-surface): a fact that cannot
be expressed on the surface is either procedure, in which case it belongs in a skill, or a
project-specific skill. A skill therefore states procedure for its own role legitimately, and the
hazard there is a *value* rather than a rule —
[#19](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/19)'s sweep. Its citations are still held by
check 1: a skill already carries one, and a dead citation in a skill is a dead citation.

Check 3 permits a third, partial home. A ruling whose outcome is split between the surface and the
skill that carries it may name `the skill` **alongside** a section — ruling 6 does — but never
instead of one. That carve-out is in the script, so it is stated here too.

## The check must not become one more copy of the principles

⛔ A check that hardcoded the loop's role count, the list of axes, or which facets have an absent
case would have to be edited on every change to the surface whose
[single-authority claim](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#the-configuration-surface) it
enforces — this repository's own thesis violated in its own gate, and a copy that has to be kept
in sync is the defect rather than the maintenance burden.

So the script **derives every expectation from the schema at run time** and hardcodes grammar
only:

| Derived, at run time | Hardcoded |
|---|---|
| the section list, from the headings | markdown heading syntax |
| the anchor set, from the same | the code host's slug rule |
| the key vocabulary, from the fenced blocks | yaml top-level key syntax |
| the citation targets, from the anchors | the citation and outcome-cell forms |
| the rulings, from the table carrying the `Outcome lives in` column | that column's name |
| | the binding marker, and which document plays which role |

Adding a section to the schema grows what the script expects with no edit to the script, and
check 2 reddens until a document motivates it. Deleting one shrinks it the same way. Renumbering
one changes nothing either — the rulings table is found by its column header rather than by a
section number, which was a deliberate second pass: the first draft keyed on the literal heading
`## 4. The rulings`, so inserting any section above it would have broken the check on a content
change.

**The only thing that forces an edit is a change of grammar** — a new marker, a new citation
form, a new column name, a new kind of document — and that residue is made loud rather than
silent by check 0: a markdown document at the root, under `docs/`, or under `plugins/` with no
declared role fails the build instead of being quietly skipped.

This is [#28](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/28)'s own finding applied here — the
sixth instance counted in
[`configuration-surface.md`](configuration-surface.md#the-strongest-argument-for-extraction-is-not-borrowed)
is another project's document checker, and this guard is a seventh: the graph a machine walks and
the statement a person maintains are deliberately one thing, read from one place.

## What it deliberately does not check

Stated, because an unstated limit reads later as coverage.

- **Fidelity.** Whether a document's paraphrase still matches the section it cites is the
  *quoting* kind: red on an innocent reword, green when a claim is reworded into its opposite.
  No check here attempts it. It stays a reviewer's job, which is why a document paraphrases as
  little as it can and cites instead.
- **Issue state.** Check 3 resolves the *form* of a work-item cell, not whether that issue is
  still open. Reading the tracker needs a token scope, and per
  [#50](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/50) this workflow is granted none: its
  `permissions` are empty and the checkout is told to persist no credential. So a ruling whose
  work item landed without its outcome moving into the schema is caught by a reader, not by the
  gate — the one gap in check 3 worth knowing about, and a deliberate trade against holding a
  credential to close it.
- **Key subtrees.** Check 5 holds the top level only. Per-tracker blocks live in `examples/` by
  the schema's own
  [§ 3](../plugins/mjolnir/config/schema.md#3-tracker-port), so a deeper comparison would need an
  exception per tracker kind. A bounded check that is sound beats a deep one that needs
  carve-outs, and `tracker.labels` being undeclared is the known consequence.
- **Issues and pull requests.** That store is not a file and cannot be swept from a gate at all,
  which is the same reason [#19](https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mjolnir/issues/19) records for
  lettering projects A–F in the documentation.
- **Configurations outside the globs.** A configuration added where `CONFIG_GLOBS` does not look
  is skipped. Check 0's loud-residue argument covers documents; for configurations the guard
  asserts only that each glob matched something, which catches a moved directory but not a new
  one somewhere else.

## Each check has a violation it is asserted to redden on

`--self-test` plants one violation per check and asserts that check goes red, as the first step of
the workflow — before the tree is held to anything. The discipline is #28's: an assertion written
before its break tends to match only the break its author imagined, and a check that cannot fail
is not a check.

That mode caught its own author. The first draft of the anchor rule collapsed runs of whitespace
where the code host replaces each space individually, which reported six sound citations as broken
— so the first finding this check produced was against itself, which is the reading rule #28
states: when one goes red, the assertion is as likely to be wrong as the document.
